Pivot Table layout change.",8.24 seconds,,0.10 seconds,"[START]
Reason: To demonstrate the key features of Excel that allow you to easily manage and analyze data in your pivot tables, such as the ability to quickly filter, sort, and view multiple pivot tables side by side on one worksheet or across different worksheets and workbooks. This will also help you understand how to tailor a pivot table to meet specific needs for better insights from your data.
Step: Highlight the entire column containing date information (if it's in a column A) using the ""Select"" method, then select the range of cells that includes both date columns (columns B and C). Go to the ""Insert"" tab and click on the ""Pivot Table"" button. In the new dialogue box, choose the cell where you want your pivot table to be placed and select ""New Worksheet"". Click ""OK"", then drag the column header for Date into the ""Row Labels"" field.
Step: Drag the column header for Value (column D) into the ""Values"" field. This will create a pivot table with date as row labels and value as data. To easily filter your pivot table by year, click anywhere in your pivot table and go to the ""Analyze"" tab. Click on ""Filter"", then drag the dropdown arrow next to Date and select ""Year"". A dropdown menu with each year will appear. You can now choose a specific year or all years by selecting ""All"" from the dropdown list.
Step: Now that you have your pivot table filtered by year, go back to the ""Analyze"" tab and click on ""Sort & Filter"". Choose ""Sort Smallest to Largest"" in the Sort By field and select ""Values"" for sort order (ascending or descending). This will arrange your value column from lowest to highest within each year. If you want to make it easier to compare data across years, go back to the ""Data"" tab and click on ""Totals & Centers of Gravity"". Then, drag the dropdown arrow next to Year to create a new field called Year Total or Year Center of Gravity, which will display total or average value for each year.
Step: To customize your pivot table further and make it more user-friendly, go back to the ""Design"" tab on the ribbon. Click on the ""Summary & Grouping"" group. Here you can choose how often to summarize (e.g., monthly), which items to sum or average, and whether to group them together. You can also add new fields by dragging and dropping an existing field into the ""Fields"" section. This allows for easy inclusion of additional data like region names, product codes, etc. Once your pivot table design is finalized, go back to the ""Analyze"" tab and click on ""Troubleshoot Pivot Table"" if you encounter any issues or errors during these steps.
